## Cost Comparison (Estimated)

| Backend | Setup Cost | Monthly Cost (100GB) | Operational Cost |
|---------|------------|---------------------|------------------|
| NIO | $0 | $0 (disk only) | Minimal |
| Redis | $0-$50 | $50-$200 | Low |
| AWS S3 | $0 | $2-$5 | Medium |
| Azure Blob | $0 | $2-$5 | Medium |
| Firestore | $0 | $18-$36 | Medium |
| **Kafka** | $100-$500 | $50-$300 | **High** |

*Note: Kafka costs include cluster infrastructure (brokers, ZooKeeper/KRaft). Managed services (Confluent Cloud, AWS MSK) cost more but reduce operational overhead.*

## Performance Comparison (Estimated)

| Backend | Write Latency | Read Latency | Throughput |
|---------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| NIO | <1ms | <1ms | 1GB/s+ |
| Redis | 1-5ms | <1ms | 500MB/s |
| AWS S3 | 50-200ms | 20-100ms | 100MB/s |

## Unique Kafka Capabilities

### 1. Event Streaming Integration

Kafka AFS allows you to treat storage operations as events:

```csharp
// Storage writes become Kafka events
storage.Store(customer);  // → Produces event to Kafka

// Other systems can consume these events
var consumer = new KafkaConsumer<string, byte[]>(config);
consumer.Subscribe("customer-data-topic");
// Process storage events in real-time
```

### 2. Time Travel

Read data as it existed at any point in time:

```csharp
// Read current state
var currentData = storage.Root<Customer>();

// Read state from 1 hour ago (via offset)
var historicalData = kafkaConnector.ReadAtOffset(topic, offsetOneHourAgo);
```

### 3. Complete Audit Trail

Every write is immutable and logged:

```csharp
// Query all changes to a file
var auditTrail = kafkaConnector.GetAuditTrail(filePath);
foreach (var change in auditTrail)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{change.Timestamp}: {change.Operation}");
}
```

### 4. Multi-Datacenter Replication

Kafka's MirrorMaker enables cross-datacenter replication:

```
DC1 (Primary)     →  MirrorMaker  →  DC2 (Replica)
Kafka Cluster                         Kafka Cluster
```

---

## Migration Path

If you start with one backend and want to switch to Kafka later:

1. **NIO → Kafka:** Export data, import to Kafka topics
2. **Redis → Kafka:** Stream Redis data to Kafka
3. **S3 → Kafka:** Batch import S3 objects to Kafka
4. **Azure/GCP → Kafka:** Use cloud connectors

All AFS adapters implement the same `IBlobStoreConnector` interface, making migration straightforward.

---

## Conclusion

**Kafka AFS is a specialized adapter** that shines in event-driven architectures where:
- Storage operations need to be observable as events
- Audit trails and compliance are critical
- Time travel capabilities are valuable
- You already have Kafka infrastructure

For simpler use cases, **NIO, Redis, or cloud storage** are better choices due to lower complexity and operational overhead.

---

**Recommendation:** Start with a simpler backend (NIO for dev, Redis/S3 for production) and migrate to Kafka only when you have specific requirements that justify the additional complexity.
